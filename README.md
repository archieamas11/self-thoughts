## ‚ú® Overview

Self Thoughts is a React Native (Expo) application that lets users quickly journal entries, track mood, and manage a lightweight personal profile. It focuses on:

* Fast launch & zero required signup (anonymous local profile with a whimsical autogenerated name)
* Offline-first storage using resilient SQLite access layer
* Mood tagging & favorites to surface meaningful entries
* Simple, distraction‚Äëfree UI designed for daily reflections

This repository showcases clean state isolation (Context + service layer), defensive database initialization, and pragmatic TypeScript patterns‚Äîintended both as a learning artifact and a foundation for future growth (sync, analytics, cloud backup, etc.).

## üß† Core Features

* Create, edit, and delete journal entries
* Archive entries (soft removal from active list)
* Mark / unmark favorites
* Auto-generated human‚Äëfriendly profile name on first launch
* Editable profile (name, bio, picture placeholder logic)
* Mood capture (emoji / label fields)
* Deterministic local persistence (SQLite via `expo-sqlite` with retry + health checks)
* Graceful fallback & reinitialization on DB errors
* Typed context API (`JournalContext`) powering UI

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* React Native 0.79 / React 19
* Expo 53 (Router v5, Fonts, Web Browser, SQLite, Splash)
* TypeScript
* SQLite via `expo-sqlite` (with in-memory fallback for Web)
* Firebase config stub (future: auth, storage, sync)
* Icons: `@expo/vector-icons`, `lucide-react-native`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Development

Prerequisites:

* Node 18+ (LTS recommended)
* Expo CLI (auto-installed via `npx` if absent)

Steps:

1. Clone

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/archieamas11/self-thoughts.git
   cd self-thoughts
   ```

2. Install deps

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run in development (interactive bundler)

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open on device / emulator (Expo Go QR or Android emulator).

### Build (Android - EAS Preview)

```bash
npm run build
```

Configure EAS credentials before running a production build.

## üîê Environment & Secrets

Currently the `firebase.ts` file includes a raw config object (client-side keys). For production hardening:

* Move secrets to secure remote config or environment injection
* Add `.env` support (e.g., `expo-env` or `react-native-config`)
* Restrict Firebase API key usage via domain / package-level restrictions

## üöÄ Roadmap Ideas

* Cloud sync / backup (Firebase / Supabase)
* Authentication (optional sign-in for multi-device)
* Rich text / markdown support
* Mood analytics dashboard
* Tagging & search
* Encrypted local storage layer
* Export (PDF / Markdown share)
* Dark mode theming refinements
* Customizable reminders / notifications
* Achievements / streaks to encourage daily journaling

## üß© Scripts

| Script              | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`       | Start Expo development server           |
| `npm run build`     | EAS build (Android preview profile)     |
| `npm run build:web` | Export (currently targets android flag) |
| `npm run lint`      | Run Expo + ESLint linting               |

## üß± Database Schema Summary

Tables:

* `journal_entries` (id, title, content, date, mood, moodLabel, flags, timestamps)
  * Indexes: `date`, `isArchived`, `isFavorite`
* `user_profile` (singleton row id=1: name, bio, picture)

Resilience Patterns:

* Connection re-init on error
* Retry for inserts (up to 3 attempts)
* Health check via `SELECT 1`
